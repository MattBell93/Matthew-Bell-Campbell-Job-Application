                            Hello, my name is Matt and this is my application to work at the Campbell Clinic. I am currently in my second year after qualification, working as a Dental Core Trainee (DCT) in an Oral Surgery and Orthodontics department in Kingâ€™s Lynn.<br> 
                            <br>
                            I am very excited to submit an application for this role, as I believe working at the Campbell clinic would provide the perfect combination of clinical dentistry whilst incorporating my love of academia, by being able to help carry out research, attend exceptional courses to enhance my own knowledge, and hopefully some teaching experience.
                            <br>
                            Outside of work, I have recently started a course on web design, so decided to create this website from scratch as an alternative form of job application! <br>
                            <br>
                            I initially decided to study this course with a desire to create content with the aim of informing patients about oral health and dental treatment, in order to combat one of the single biggest obstacles I encountered whilst working with the general public: patient education, whilst simultaneously acting as a creative outlet. <br> 
                            <br>
                            I am keen to further these skills into developing animated videos, and branching out into data science, to be able to query, analyse and visualise data. <br> 
                            <br>
                            In my spare time I also enjoy upcycling second hand furniture and exploring the beaches and hidden beauty of Norfolk.
