        <h2 class="Title">Teaching</h1>
            <p>
                I have been fortunate to gain some limited teaching experience, in various forms, which I find to be one of the most rewarding aspects of my career 
                <br>
            <ul>
                <li><p class="tooth_bullet" ></p>  Dental School (2016-2018)</li>
                    
                    <p>Assisted in the teaching of first year dental students in preparation for their OSCEs to allow attendance on clinics. This ranged from working with small groups on basics such as instrument identification, to single-handedly organising mock 5-station OSCEs for around 20+ students.</p>
                    
                <li><p class="tooth_bullet" ></p>  Notebook Tutors Ltd (2016-2018)</li>
                    
                    <p>Personal tutor for secondary school students in Maths and Biology, with devised lesson plans and homework. 
                    
                <li><p class="tooth_bullet" ></p>  Debate Chamber (2016-2018)</li>
                    
                    <p>Touching back on my interest in widening participation, I had the opportunity to work for this organisation in delivering weekend “dentistry summer-school” classes for students aged 14-17, in groups of 10-12, from all backgrounds. These classes covered multiple aspects of dentistry, from a basic examination, to ethics and consent, to covering basics of dental specialties such as Orthodontics and Periodontology. Debate Chamber were also fortunate enough to allow me to cover some practical aspects, such as suturing.</p> 
                    
                <li><p class="tooth_bullet" ></p>  Maltings Dental Pactice (2018-2019)</li>
                    
                    <p>Throughout my time at Maltings, I was happy to help some of the dental nurses in their further qualifications. This included conducting mock interviews for an Oral Hygiene Instructor qualification, and background in conscious sedation. I was also instrumental in altering the practice of two current nurses who run oral hygiene clinics, teaching them about the use of modified plaque and bleeding scores as a quantitative measure of improvement of oral hygiene, and overseeing them carrying out these investigations.</p> 
                    
                <li><p class="tooth_bullet" ></p>  Queen Elizabeth Hospital</li>
                
                    <p>Currently putting together a lecture aimed at any healthcare professionals within the hospital who wish to learn about managing the oral health of their inpatients, covering basics of dental anatomy, oral health instruction and denture care.</p> 
            
            </ul>
                <p>Teaching and education is extremely gratifying, and I am confident in stating in my future career I would be looking for a post that would include, for example, working in a dental school teaching undergraduates, teaching on courses aimed at qualified dentists of all levels, or even setting up a similar course aimed at widening participation with the hope of exciting secondary school students interested about a possible career in dentistry.</p>
