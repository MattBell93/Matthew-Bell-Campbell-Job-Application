            <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>Fuelled by my undergraduate degree, one of the main areas of research I am interested in is regarding regenerative dentistry. One such example of this is a literature review: “Stem Cell Therapies to Recover Salivary Gland Function in Head and Neck Cancer Radiotherapy Patients”, published in the dental school monthly newspaper.</p>
              
                <h4>Souyave  Prize in Endodontics</h4>
                
                <p>In my final year at dental school, I won the Souyave Prize in Endodontics for both my clinical work in endodontics, and a literature review: “Tissue Engineering in Regenerative Endodontics”.</p> 

                <p>Further to this, I am fascinated about the cellular and molecular mechanisms regarding osseointegration of implants.</p> 

                <p>I am also currently working towards a poster presentation on a patient introduced to me at a Multi-disciplinary meeting, regarding abnormal growth of a squamous cell carcinoma, covering the left dorsum of her tongue, however mapping biopsies show the SCC to only be a few cell layers deep. In producing this case, I will develop skills in public speaking and presentation as well as working within a multidisciplinary team, both of which, I believe will serve me well in this job role.</p>

            <h3>Clinical Interests</h3>

                Whilst I enjoy all aspects of clinical dentistry, I am particularly drawn to Oral surgery and periodontology, hence I am keen to gain as much experience from my year in an oral surgery department to enhance my surgical skills as much as possible, with the hope of sitting Part 1 of the examinations for the Royal Colleges later this year. 
                <br>
                <h4>SAAD Sedation Course</h4>
                    One surprise I learnt about myself working in practice was how much I enjoyed treating children and anxious patients, finding getting through a procedure alongside a particularly nervous patient, or a child extremely rewarding. However, I wanted to push myself further in being able to help these patients, and have signed up for the SAAD sedation course, which I will be attending in March 2020, further enhanced by  the experience I am currently receiving in the Oral Surgery department.  

            <h3>Audit</h3>   

                Audits are vital in improving patient care, here are the audits I have been involved in: 
                <ol>
                    <li>Adherence to Delivering Better Oral Health (DBOH) with regards to caries prevention – Malting’s Dental Practice 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Assessing compliance of clinicians on important but often overlooked aspects of caries prevention as stated in DBOH: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prescription of high fluoride toothpaste for patients in active fixed appliance orthodontic treatment</li> 

                            <li>Prescription of high fluoride toothpaste in high caries risk children ages 8-9</li>

                            <li>Assessment of brushing status of children up to 6 years old (e.g. supervised brushing, brushing alone etc)</li>

                            <li>Fluoride varnish application age limit (16 vs 18y.o.)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                    <li>Pre-operative Assessment of Conscious sedation patients – Queen Elizabeth Hospital</li>
                        <br>
                    Assessing compliance of assessing clinicians to department guidelines regarding suitability for conscious sedation. Currently in initial data collection phase.
